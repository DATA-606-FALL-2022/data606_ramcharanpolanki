## Project Title:  SYNTHETIC FACE GENERATION

#### _1. What is your issue of interest?_

Synthetic Face Generation, is gaining a lot of attraction in current days.
> "The coolest idea in the last 20 years" - quoted by Yann LeCun

 Numerous applications exist for synthetic face generation, such as data augmentation for machine learning models, use in animated films or cartoon characters, generating influencer marketing, and so on. GANs, which stands for Generative Adversarial Networks, are the innovation behind all this.
In recent years, numerous firms and R&Ds have begun to focus heavily on GANs. Facebook is working hard on this in order to use new faces in the metaverse. Before it was revealed that she was really not real, an Instagram advertiser named Miquela Sousa accumulated over a million followers.

 >"Until my conversation with Nikola, it seemed like an indisputable fact that Miquela wasn’t real" - quoted by a reporter from "The Cut"
 
 The success stories of GANs reflects on the impact they create in society.
 
#### _2. Why is this issue important to you and/or others?_

It is extremely prevalent in data science to encounter issues such as: the dataset is not large enough, the dataset is not disparate enough, the volume of data present for one label outperforms the amount of data present for another. We personally encountered this problem while developing a model for an attendance system based on face recognition. In these kind of cases, face synthesis can be used as a data augmentation technique to generate more data. Microsoft created an entire dataset of synthetic faces. When different models were tested, their performance was much better than models trained on normal datasets on test data. According to Microsoft, this is due to the increased diversity in the dataset.
Content creators can employ this strategy when they need images of a large number of individuals (as in the metaverse) or when they need to use a face for some controversial matter that may be upsetting to the person whose face is showcased. The very same method can be applied to anime images, saving valuable time and effort for anime character artists and creators when creating new anime characters. This method also has the potential to make avatars.
 
#### _3. What questions do you have in your mind and would like to answer?_

As previously stated, synthetic face generation is a topic of research with numerous applications. Our research identifies and stores the key features that must be present in a face, and we create new faces by maintaining the key features constant while modifying the other features. The model will handle the following actions:

- Make a new face
- Determine whether a face is real or artificial.

We have a lot of questions about GANs because we are new to them. Some of them include:-

- What are the model's major performance indicators?
- Can we give the model some input parameters to get a specific type of face? (for example, a face of a specific ethnicity) - Will the generated faces be truly indistinguishable from human faces?
- Will the faces generated by the computer be dissimilar?
(For example, can we build a model other than the discriminator that is trained alongside the generator to distinguish between synthetic and real faces?) - Are the generated faces usable in other models?
- Is it possible to induce a specific feature, such as a smile, in the faces by adjusting an input parameter?
- Is it possible to generalize the model so that we can input an image and the model will generate images based on the input image?
 

#### _4. Where do you get the data to analyze and help answer your questions?_

We obtained the dataset from the source below:-

http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html

It is called the celebA dataset and contains over 200,000 face images along with different tags.
The data is from a trusted source which is Multimedia lab from "The Chinese University of Hong Kong".
The data contains over 38 different attributes namely, 
- 5_o_Clock_Shadow
- Arched_Eyebrows
- Attractive
- Bags_Under_Eyes
- Bald
- Bangs
- Big_Lips
- Big_Nose
- Black_Hair
- Blond_Hair
- Blurry
- Brown_Hair
- Bushy_Eyebrows
- Chubby
- Double_Chin
- Eyeglasses
- Goatee
- Gray_Hair
- Heavy_Makeup
- High_Cheekbones
- Male
- Mouth_Slightly_Open
- Mustache
- Narrow_Eyes
- No_Beard
- Oval_Face
- Pale_Skin
- Pointy_Nose
- Receding_Hairline
- Rosy_Cheeks
- Sideburns
- Smiling
- Straight_Hair
- Wavy_Hair
- Wearing_Earrings
- Wearing_Hat
- Wearing_Lipstick
- Wearing_Necklace

#### _5. What questions do you have in your mind and would like to answer?_

Here, the unit of analysis is the location

#### _6. What variables/measures do you plan to use in your analysis?_

The train data will contain face images as input data. 
The aim will be to make the images indistinguishible by a discriminator.

#### _7. What kinds of techniques/models do you plan to use?_

We will employ a GAN model.
There are several 2d convolutions in it. 
For pre - processing stage, we will also use strategies for image processing.
A block digram of how the model looks is shown below:-

#### _8. How do you plan to develop/apply ML and how do you evaluate performance of models?_

We intend to use Google Collaboratory, which can provide GPU and keras libraries for the creation of convolution networks.
GANs, unlike some other networks, are extremely challenging to evaluate because we are simply producing new images that cannot be compared to any other.
The following are some qualitative methodologies for analyzing GAN generator models:
- Neighbors in the Neighborhood.
- Scene Categorization in a Flash.
- Evaluating and Preference Evaluation.
- Mode Drop & Collapse evaluation.
- Exploring and Envisioning Network Internals

However, which method to use should be determined through in-depth assessment after the model is created, based on the face quality that the model produces.

#### _9. What outcomes do you intend to achieve?_

The project's goal is to develop a model that can generate faces that cannot be distinguished by individuals or automated systems. We hope to learn more about machine learning techniques, software requirements, convolution neural networks, and other topics as an outcome of this project.
